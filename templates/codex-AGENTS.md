# OmniContext For Codex

When working in this repository:

1. Read `.omnicontext/INDEX.md` first.
2. Identify the active project from the current task or touched files.
3. Read `.omnicontext/projects/<project>/overview.md` and `.omnicontext/projects/<project>/handoff.md` before making substantial changes.
4. Read `.omnicontext/shared/` only when shared standards or architecture rules matter.
5. Read `.omnicontext/personal/` only when user preferences affect output or workflow.
6. After durable progress, update the relevant `handoff.md`, `todo.md`, or `decisions.md`.
7. Do not store secrets, tokens, or private credentials in `.omnicontext/`.
